# Extraction of secondary strutures of protein from DSSP database
This repository contains a Python script that leverages Biopython to extract secondary structure information from PDB files using the DSSP algorithm. The script processes protein structures and retrieves their primary sequences and corresponding secondary structure elements, outputting a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Installing DSSP
DSSP is a standalone program that must be installed separately. Instructions for installation can be found on the DSSP website.
